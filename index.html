          <p>
            Sleep talk is an area of research that remains largely neglected —
            slept upon — due to the seeming unimportance of the topic. It looks
            like there is no urgency for research, after all, it is perceived as
            nonsensical babble, simply a by-product of dreaming. With my
            research, I highlight and speculate upon the possibilities that are
            opened up through recording, documenting, transcribing and sharing
            sleep talk, which would challenge the predominant perception of this
            topic and potentially open up new lines of research relevant in both
            scientific and artistic perspectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            I present sleep talk in a new light: one of turning non-productivity
            into productivity, giving sleep talk the platform and importance
            that it deserves. I will bring this to light by combining examples
            of artists (Sophie Calle, Mirtha Dermisache, Jim Shaw, Federico
            Fellini), psychological references (‘Why We Sleep’ by Matthew
            Walker, ‘The Reinterpretation of Dreams: An Evolutionary Hypothesis
            of the Function of Dreaming’ by Antti Revonsuo, ‘Synaesthesia—A
            Window Into Perception, Thought and Language’ by V. S.
            Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard and ‘The Hill Cognitive-Experiential
            Model of Dream Interpretation’ by Clara E. Hill and Aaron B.
            Rochlen) along with my own experiences, interpretations and arsenal
            of sleep talk snippets, recorded over the past four years, much of
            which I have shared on @mayasleeptalks on Instagram. This was the
            starting point for my Visual Essay exploration, where I decode the
            transcript of the night using childhood drawings and other ephemera.
            In doing so, I create a foundation for a visual language that aims
            to connect the past, present and future, observing recurring themes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this framework, I uncover how recollecting experiences,
            synthesising events from the past, present and future, and employing
            the method of ‘double-archiving’ can be helpful tools, especially in
            creating a visual language through drawing. How moving from the
            individual to the wider collective, along with the act of dream
            transcription in itself, are tools for capturing interesting
            narratives, and making these narratives accessible to a wider
            audience. Expressing narratives through drawing adds the element of
            materiality that these otherwise ephemeral narratives require,
            especially to be understood and listened to by others.

            — all in the comfort of my own bed. It’s a time of day, or rather
            night, dedicated specifically to processing and unravelling, finding
            patterns, dwelling upon and pondering. A safe-space for limitlessly
            weaving narratives together, joining fragments of ideas and visions
            — for storytelling. Logic and plausibility play no role here. While
            dreaming, I explore narratives that I never would have been able to
            reach in a conscious state. Unfortunately, our dreamt-up ideas are
            unreachable, ephemeral, once the morning glow wakes us up. We know
            there is something special amongst these ideas, but they are too
            magical, too confusing to put into words. Into something our
            consciousness can understand. What if we could put those ideas into
            words? Well, I do, and that is through sleep talk.

            Over the past four years, I have recorded many nights of my own
            sleep talk. The act of recording forever preserves the precious
            ideas that would otherwise seem unfathomably hard to describe. I
            have hundreds of snippets of the ideas that splurge out of my mouth,
            be it nonsense<sup

            or recounts of recent events. Recently, a friend and I were scouring
            the city trying to find standard envelopes (Gengler). We couldn’t
            find the correct envelopes anywhere and the extensive search efforts
            gave me a headache. After returning home and indulging in a night of
            sleep, I woke up, vaguely remembering a dream about envelopes. I
            opened Prime Sleep Recorder, the app I use to record my sleep talk,
            and listened to what I had chatted about that night, as I do every
            morning. Funnily enough, I was so concerned about the envelopes, I
            had even talked about them at precisely 04:31

            Sharing narratives harvested by recording sleep talk, encourages a
            culture of vulnerability, and I will explore this further by looking
            at Jim Shaw’s ‘Dreams’, and Federico Fellini’s ‘The Book of Dreams’,
            who both use drawing as a tool of expression to share narratives
            with others, challenging the idea of dreams being a personal,
            non-shareable entity (Fellini, 7). Often when I sleep talk, it
            sounds like I am having a one-sided conversation. It feels like
            there is a desire to connect. As Kae Tempest says, to activate a
            piece, you need to be able to share it, but also to have someone to
            listen (49). This applies not only in the realm of speech and sound,
            but also in the context of graphic design. This is how you elevate
            an idea into something much more, into something that connects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although not everybody sleep talks, this thesis aims to open a
            discussion — how to channel our subconscious ideas into material
            that can be used for narrative-creation, for communication, for
            connection. This is what design is all about. For me, it may be
            creating an archive of audio recordings, transcripts that are
            generated as I’m dreaming. For others, this may be dream journaling,
            dream interpretation, or at the very least the willingness to
            acknowledge the power the subconscious has in terms of idea
            generation, pattern finding and creativity. Furthermore, future
            technologies like MRI scanning (in a more affordable, less intrusive
            form) may start becoming available to artists. This would open up
            opportunities for the creation of a harmonious visual language,
            bridging interpretations of brain images during sleep with visual
            interpretations of sleep talk.

            I revel in the warmth and comfort of my bed. The lingering comfort,
            even after the night’s experiences are over. The warm blanket of
            inter-tangled nonsense trying to straighten itself out, ready to
            brace the day, the real world. Remaining under this blanket,
            overloaded, overwhelmed, feels like bliss. This feeling of the night
            as a safe space is no illusion. In fact, dreaming serves a purpose:
            “overnight therapy” (Walker 204-207). The hormone noradrenaline
            allows us to process painful memories of the past during the night,
            using NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep phase) to store individual
            memories in long-term storage, and REM sleep (the Rapid Eye Movement
            phase) to observe patterns and create connections that were
            previously unseen. This is the way we learn a new language. The
            special way that the brain can find connections, scanning for rules
            and coming to conclusions is something unique to sleep.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since noradrenaline removes the edge and reality off memories, it
            allows for processing and connecting of memories without feelings of
            shame or judgement. In a sense, it is a limitless space where
            creativity and ideas can blossom, without fear of repercussions,
            without having to answer to logical questions such as ‘how?’ and
            ‘why?’. I remember the clashing pink and blue dress my grandma used
            to wear as she tended to her cucumbers, in the garden, during the
            30-degree scorching heat (Holovenko). I remember a nosebleed, a
            paddling pool. Back to the present day, I have a nosebleed. The
            following night, I dream of my grandma. I connect her pink and blue
            dress to the pink and blue bouquet of flowers I saw as I walk by the
            florist. Her memory lives on in the wonderland of sleepy processing
            of unrelated experiences. By sparking connections, we make links
            that we otherwise wouldn’t have thought of. Allowing these
            insightful patterns to take a hold of us, means we allow the biases
            of the everyday to float away, and we uncover new narratives that
            are free from any constraints.
          </p>

          <p>
            The processing that occurs within dreaming is linked to
            problem-solving abilities, as shown by leading researchers, (Walker
            221-230). This means you can use dreaming as a way to create ideas
            and solutions for worries you have in your life. If you are worried
            about an interaction that will happen in a week, you may dream of
            the interaction and the noradrenaline released in your brain will
            provide a safe space for you to deal with the future, combining
            experiences from the past and the present.

            In the realm of sleep talk, this is relevant to the idea that sleep
            talk can sound like nonsense. Sleeping and dreaming can be seen as
            something unimportant, something that you can skip a few hours of if
            you have an upcoming deadline. But the truth is, they are part of
            our instinct, not something we chose. And as an effect of this
            condition, sleep-talk should not be dismissed as non-important. Even
            though sleep talk is an unintentional by-product of dreaming, it
            doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable. It is a collection and documentation
            of your dreams – a transcript. A play-by-play, an in-the-moment
            rationalisation of the ideas and patterns that are entangled in the
            confusing web of dreams. Sleep talk enables direct access and
            insight to the creativity of the subconscious.
          </p>

          <p>
            This transcript is an ever-updated catalogue of past, present and
            future memories. How could this ever not be useful?

            A stimulating connection that is made during sweet slumber could be
            forever lost, if not for the tools available that enable the
            recording of sleep talk. Waking up in the morning is exciting when I
            know my (not so) genius ideas have been harvested by the hard work
            of Prime Sleep Recorder. Silence is filtered out; only pure gold and
            some loud snores are left over. The path has been paved that enables
            me to access the narratives that I have spun and woven overnight.
            The unique connections that would take super strength to make during
            the day, but come so effortlessly to us during the night, have been
            documented and laid out, easily accessible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tension between the conscious, in the sense of “perceiving,
            apprehending, or noticing with a degree of controlled thought or
            observation” (Merriam-Webster) and the subconscious, or “the part of
            your mind that notices and remembers information when you are not
            actively trying to do so” (Cambridge) is what makes the
            interpretation of the transcript interesting. The difference seems
            to be within the intentionality, so combining these two states of
            mind, weaving in and out of control, can cast light on narratives
            and perspectives previously hidden in the shade of our minds.

            First, I archive through the night, through the act of dreaming,
            sleep talking, processing the day, making natural connections,
            memories floating through my brain. Then, I archive during the day,
            reviewing the audio recordings of the night, filtering through the
            snores and mumbles and structuring what has been created, making
            sense of what has occurred, be that through posting on Instagram or

            The act of this ‘double archiving’ layers the natural subconscious
            of the night with the structured consciousness of the day, creating
            an interesting angle to view the world. This is specifically the
            collection and patterns that are unique to me, my own curation.
            Although, it is important to mention that I am not the single
            creator of this curation, as every input from every experience,
            conversation, and encounter with those around me has led to these
            thoughts and feelings.

          <p>
            What is so exciting about this documentation, is that recently,
            scientists have established how to decode and visualise dreams using
            MRI (Walker 197). However, the visualisations are very limited. For
            example, it is possible to tell when someone is dreaming about a
            man, a woman, or an animal, but it is not possible to tell when
            someone is dreaming about “the forest bunny”<sup

            This is where documentation of sleep talk comes in handy. By
            gathering an archive of sleep talk across multiple years, I have
            been able to analyse each entry, looking for patterns not only
            across one night of sleep, but across the entire archive. For
            example, nature is a prominent theme<sup

            Could looking at recurring themes that our subconscious brings to
            light help us get better insight into ourselves and the narratives
            we truly feel are important? An interesting direction for future
            research would be to explore this question through methods of Corpus
            Linguistics and corpus-based lexicography (e.g. Sinclair; McEnery &
            Hardie, Kilgarriff et al.), which looks for such recurring patterns
            in large collections of naturally occurring texts, reading it
            ‘vertically’, not only ‘horizontally’. With the help of these
            methods and tools, my ‘sleep talk corpus’ could become a source for
            creating a visual dictionary of my dreams.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is also relevant for those unfortunate enough not to sleep
            talk. Listening to our subconscious can be a vital tool for
            recognising ongoing themes, worries and other patterns that our
            conscious may ignore. This can be done through dream journaling as
            well as therapeutically discussing dreams. In fact, the Hill
            Cognitive-Experiential Model of Dream Interpretation discovered that
            “dream reports include personally significant elements that may help
            in gaining self-understanding” (qtd. in Revonsuo 898).
          </p>

          <p>
            As important as dream journaling and talking about dreams is, I want
            to focus on sleep talk documentation as the tool we need to extract
            nocturnal ideas without the interference and the clumsiness of the
            consciousness. When we are awake, we try to rationalise and explain
            what we dreamt in the night, in terms that we deem normal and
            understandable, but in this way, we butcher the beauty of the
            irregular, the irrational. Recording sleep talk is the clear bridge
            between the conscious and subconscious: a transcript that may
            sometimes be hard to understand, but is pure, and full of blemishes
            that are in fact, not blemishes at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Giving so much attention to our dreams fuels a positive feedback
            loop that allows us to get a much wider understanding of the
            narratives created. The subconscious uses REM sleep to make quick,
            seemingly random connections between unrelated topics, extracting
            patterns previously unseen, then, in the day, you complete the
            ‘double archiving’ by searching through recurring themes, such as by
            searching and analysing through dream journaling, or in my case,
            searching and analysing my archive of sleep talk recordings. While
            thinking about sleep talk so much, I fuel more patterns to be found
            while asleep, based on the patterns I found while awake. And on it
            goes!
          </p>

          <p>
            Recording in itself means giving importance to something,
            preserving. Back to the idea of non-importance, we can also touch
            upon productivity, in the sense of the definition, that ”a lot of
            good or useful things happen as a result of it” (Collins).
            Chattering nonsense while in a blissful slumber can be seen as
            worthless, non-productive but with the connections being made, and
            stories being recorded, there is a goldmine of things to hear,
            things to imagine when going through what has been said<sup

            talk is necessary for the improvement of how we construct
            narratives. Even for those that do not sleep talk, the sharing of
            these narratives can be insightful, which will be discussed in the
            following chapter. Free of judgement and other constraints, what we
            say during the night is the purest form an idea can take.

            Antti Revonsuo’s research on the function of dreaming indicates that
            dreaming is evolutionarily necessary for simulating threatening
            events and playing them through the night to practise threat
            avoidance(882-883). This means that we are learning to avoid
            scenarios in real life. Often the risky scenarios are the ones that
            create the most interesting stories<sup

            event <span style="font-style: italic">has</span> already been,
            albeit in our dreams. And the wonder of being able to record that
            event, without getting in any danger ourselves is invaluable. In The
            Dream World of Dion McGregor (He Talks in His Sleep), an album of
            sleep talk recordings, we become witness to these alternate universe
            narratives. McGregor speaks of “Edwina” who “got too friendly with a
            crocodile and he nipped her leg off right at the side”. These
            intensive recordings which last for multiple minutes provide a
            highly detailed insight into narratives that we would otherwise not
            be able to experience. By recording sleep talk, I give space to
            narratives that otherwise never would have gotten a chance to
            blossom. The narratives of the parallel universes, of the
            what-could-have-beens.

            Furthermore, recording sleep talk allows us to challenge the limits
            of language, similar to the way Mirtha Dermisache explores in her
            “illegible writing” (Barthes). Dermisache challenges the blocks and
            boundaries that language has created for us to be able to express
            ourselves fully. Reminiscent of childish scribbles, we are reminded
            of the time when we learnt how to write, a time where we would
            imitate what we would see, before learning the alphabet, in a
            desperate desire to express ourselves. A time where we were still
            free to explore ideas in all ways possible, before we were
            conditioned at school to think in a certain way (Podd et al.).
            Drawing a parallel, the way we expressed ourselves through those
            scribbles, linked with the creative way we thought, is similar to
            the way I express myself through the language of sleep talk, free of
            the boundaries that my conscious mind is confined to.

            chatter, is this all the pent-up energy that we have not been able
            to express previously? It is at least a step in the right direction.
            Being able to record this enables us to access language and
            communication at its most raw and pure, almost back to the childlike
            way of thinking, but with a layer added of the accumulation of
            experiences that an adult has experienced.

            it could be seen as a different way of using speech. We then begin
            to see the limitations of our speech, the societal constructs we
            have created, and how they alter in sleep talk. We push the
            boundaries of language, which allows us to push the boundaries of
            narrative-creation and symbolism. If the stories we create are
            limited to the language we use, opening up the way we use and
            interpret language can help us in opening up the way we create
            narratives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since there is a distinction between the way we see the world in our
            dreams, compared to the “real world”, there is a friction, in the
            sense that we have to interpret the subconscious using our
            conscious. There are many different ways to do this, and each
            individual will approach this differently. As an example, during my
            Visual Essay class, I used my childhood drawings as a visual
            explanation of what my sleep talk recordings could mean. I used the
            creativity I had as a child to explain these, while using a tagging
            system of the present day to explain the emotions and themes of each
            sleep talk episode.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is related to synaesthesia and sound symbolism, as explored by
            V. S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard in their research on the way
            we perceive language, specifically the way we attach meaning to
            shapes and sounds. Across different languages, they found we
            consistently assign the same name to abstract shapes, as seen in the
            following figure where 95% to 98% of participants associated the
            rounder abstract shape to the name ‘Bouba’, whereas the spiky shape
            was considered to be ‘Kiki’ (19).
          </p>

          <img

          />

          <figcaption class="caption-inside4">
            Illustration of Kiki and Bouba
          </figcaption>
          <p>
            This is an interesting observation, because it suggests that the way
            we see shapes could transcend language. In regard to sleep talk, it
            could mean that the words we hear and the sounds we make may have a
            clear association to a graphic element, which is what I have begun
            to explore with my Visual Essay.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, shape and sound are not the only elements that are at play,
            and each individual is bound to have their own interpretation. So
            let’s explore what it means to open this up, and figure out why this
            should be a collective, rather than individual experience.

          </h2>
          <p>
            So far I have discussed the use of transcription, sound symbolism,
            and the limits of language. In the pursuit of making your own
            subconscious ideas more accessible for others, transcription in
            itself is a key element, the facilitator for connectivity. By having
            my sleep talk recorded while I sleep, a transcript is generated as
            the night progresses, night after night, filling in the gaps of my
            archive, enhancing, enriching. The act of transcribing already makes
            everything grounded in our awake reality in a way that is not
            possible without. In the way the MRI machines illuminate some basic
            ideas of the night, Prime Sleep Recorder acts as an in-depth log
            book of everything that has been splurged out. Having a transcript
            that others can listen to, or that can be written down and shared
            with others, gives a way for others to understand my strange
            subconscious thoughts without the misunderstandings that can take
            place through verbal explanation. Using drawing as a medium can also
            facilitate further accessibility and understanding within the
            viewer, transforming sleep talk from a language only the speaker
            seems to understand, to a comprehensible visual language, a form of
            communication. Since we all have different experiences, opinions and
            upbringings, we could interpret a retelling of a story in a
            different way than intended. Having direct access to the transcript
            of sleep talk is the direct link, the pure primary source, which is
            further enhanced by having a clear visual language.
          </p>

            Why do our mothers start doodling on the backs of receipts when on a
            long phone call (Babych)? Why do we still have sketch artists in
            courtrooms? Drawing enables an instant expression of ideas lying
            beyond the limitations of language. To prevent the information
            residue leaking out through the filtering process of
            ‘double-archiving’, we should aim to represent information in the
            clearest way possible, especially when it comes to cloudy, confusing
            narratives that we only half understand, such as sleep talk. Drawing
            is present across all cultures, parts of the world, throughout
            history. Neil Cohn argues that drawing is an innate instinct, that
            drawing has its own repeated vocabulary and syntax structure (3). We
            can, and should, use this instinct to our advantage.
          </p>

          <p>
            This unclouded information is key to being able to convey a message
            to others as clearly as possible. If a message is in its purest
            form, this simplifies all else that is needed for good design. Once
            you boil down what graphic design really is, it is about the way you
            communicate, how to get a message from one person to the next, with
            the least amount of obfuscation and miscommunications<sup

            >For a message to really land, to be received well, you need a
            listener to activate the idea. There is no use keeping these ideas
            to yourself. We need to tune in to the desire to connect and not
            only share, but also listen. There is a real importance in sharing,
            in storytelling, it helps us cultivate a deeper empathy. A story on
            its own is nothing, it doesn’t bring up emotions just by being, it
            must be interacted with to become powerful. “The story must be read,
            the song must be listened to” (Tempest 49) as must the sleep talk,
            despite the fact that perhaps it was never intended to be perceived
            by others. When we listen to it, we give it importance. These are
            documentations of the patterns the brain makes during the night. It
            is something beautiful, humorous, human. If we pay attention and
            listen to each other, listen to each others sleep talk, listen to
            each others dream recounts, we activate narratives out of this
            world.

          <p>
            Listening to dreams, and more importantly, visualising them, has
            been an important theme for filmmakers, visual artists, and even for
            entire cultural movements. Here I will discuss just a few examples
            relevant to the topic. As a filmmaker, Federico Fellini exemplifies
            how to activate nocturnal narratives, since his dreams often creep
            into his films. By creating ‘The Book of Dreams’, Fellini uses the
            medium of drawing as a method of documentation. As he describes, his
            “scribbles, rushed and ungrammatical notes” encapsulate a language
            so indescribable, that drawing must act as a captor of ideas. In
            doing so, documenting all the nonsensical ideas and scribbles
            sprawled across your mind, you create your own grammar and structure
            for a visual language. The base of this visual language: honesty,
            vulnerability and being human.
          </p>

            Jim Shaw is another artist who feels the importance of sharing the
            vulnerable creations that are generated while sleeping, through
            drawing. By sharing an experience as intimate as dreaming — which
            occurs in a state of sleep where we are paralysed — we are
            vulnerable and become more human. We compare and contrast our
            patterns, and nurture an environment of empathy, of storytelling, of
            sharing, of listening. Bonding over basic human instinct, rather
            than the choices we make. In his book ‘Dreams’ he illustrates his
            dreams, accompanied by a text explanation of what happened. The
            narratives that appear are so unusual and uncanny in a way that the
            conscious would never have been able to dream up. By documenting and
            sharing the subconscious narratives he has created, he opens up his
            secrets, his shameful thoughts and his mind to everybody. In doing
            so, he fosters an environment in which openness and honesty are at
            the forefront. The humanising nature of doing so generates interest
            from audiences who either connect or feel a disconnect to the themes
            of the dream. However, even through the disconnect they see the
            vulnerability, which is a feeling they can connect to themselves,
            encouraging a sharing culture among others. Shaw’s original
            intention with the drawings was to have a way of archiving the
            creativity of his subconscious. In using this archiving tool, he
            collected as much inspiration as possible for potential artworks of
            the future (The Museum of Modern Art). In the same way, I try to
            share my sleep talk, as an archive accessible to all, through
            Instagram. I enjoy the conversations that the recordings kickstart,
            the interpretations that different friends have. The way some people
            find it hilarious, some find it scary. Again, sleep talk must be
            listened to in order to activate its full power.

            It is clear that I am having a conversation in my dream, however,
            the act of recording sleep talk lacks the other side of the
            conversation. As the result is a one-sided conversation, it is
            interesting to activate the work by having an audience interact,
            engage and listen to it in a conscious state, an attempt to uncover
            the narrative. Even the act of uploading it on Instagram enables
            this conversation to start to come alive, such as through the
            comment section.

            Looking further towards vulnerability and honesty in a collective
            setting, we can turn to Sophie Calle’s work. In ‘Take Care of
            Yourself’ Calle sends the break-up letter her boyfriend sent her to
            women of many different professions and asks them to analyse it from
            their perspective. She compiles each and every one of them, creating
            a big, heavy book. The result offers the reader a view inside the
            pain that Calle may have felt at the time. Exposing something so
            private in such an analytical way helps get to the core of the
            message in a humorous way. Combining such a vast array of
            perspectives and opinions creates a documentation so nuanced, that
            any one individual would not have been able to reach that point on
            their own. It is about showing what you know, but also listening to
            what others have to say<sup

            In an interview with Brian Dillon, Calle says “I have to write
            everything down before it escapes” (History Lessons No 5: Take Care
            of Yourself) and it is in the same way I am passionate about
            recording sleep talk, to document all my ideas before they escape.
            Not only this, but sharing with others, so that their perspectives
            allow the ideas to gain a life of their own through narration
            development and interpretation.

            Exposing yourself at your most vulnerable, in this case while you
            are sleeping, encourages an honest approach to design. A way for
            honest narratives to be crafted while maintaining their authenticity
            and raw feel. No sugar-coating, just genuine feelings and
            connections. As Kae Tempest puts it: naked language has a humanising
            effect (22). The naked truth is humanising, as is the raw content of
            my sleep talk recordings. Fostering an environment where we share
            and listen with honesty allows for pure connections, meaning clear
            communication from one to the other.
          </p>

          <p>
            By sharing the “off-stage self, the non-public you… the you that you
            encounter in the middle of the night… the same you that’s in
            everyone else” (16), you recognise the shared patterns that connect
            us, no matter the background or perspective.

          <h2 class="section-titles" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The potential of recording sleep talk is extraordinary. It provides
            us a base for the creation of a visual language, which will be
            enhanced with future technologies, generating an understandable,
            shareable language that transcends the limits of misunderstandings.
            Using the widely available tool of drawing enables us to draw out
            creativity, imagination, and visualise the connective pattern-making
            of the night.
          </p>

          <p>
            This field of research craves more: more recordings, more inputs,
            more outputs, more sharing, more conversations, more experiences,
            more research — both scientific and artistic. Along with these
            discoveries comes the pushing of linguistic boundaries, resulting in
            opportunities to communicate more effectively, with clarity, purpose
            and understanding. This piece of writing acts as a launchpad for my
            own practice, using the understanding of what it takes to formulate
            a visual language that communicates ideas with efficiency and
            understanding while maintaining warmth and humour. Paying attention
            to the ideas that the subconscious generates will enable ideas to
            come to life, to communicate with such vivacity and humanity that it
            will be impossible not to understand.
